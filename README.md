- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RelicSteel
I am new to coding - I joined a Boot Camp with Just It to help learn and as a way to help change my career.
So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and Python
I have enjoyed Python the most but am still learning so not 100% on if the backend dev role is the path i want just yet.
